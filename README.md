# ZipfAnalysis
Short python script to test if a pdf follows Zipf's law 

Run with:
```
python3 TestAPDF.py FileYouWantToTest.pdf
```

This will produce a plot which demonstrates the near perfect power relationship between word frequency and word rank. In theory, this could be used to determine if something is amiss with a document - similar to Benford's law!
